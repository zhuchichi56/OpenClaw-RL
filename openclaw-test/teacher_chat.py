"""
AI-to-OpenClaw GSM8K homework grading runner.

The external LLM plays a teacher who uses OpenClaw to grade student homework.
The homework files (homework/i.txt) are assumed to already exist in the workspace
(written by a prior ai_chat.py run). The teacher provides the original question
and ground truth answer to OpenClaw, asks it to grade, reviews the feedback,
and then has it appended to the file.

Required environment variables:
  OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN  - Your OpenClaw gateway auth token
  OPENAI_API_KEY          - API key for the external (teacher) LLM

Optional environment variables:
  OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL    - Gateway base URL (default: http://localhost:18789)
  OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE      - Workspace path (default: ~/.openclaw/workspace)
  OPENAI_BASE_URL         - Custom base URL for the external model
  EXTERNAL_MODEL          - Model name (default: gpt-4o)

Usage:
  python teacher_chat.py --dataset GSM8K.json --num-problems 5
  python teacher_chat.py --dataset GSM8K.json --num-problems 10 --max-turns 12

TEACHER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are role-playing as a teacher who is grading student homework. You talk casually. \
You want the AI to write comments that is detailed, patient, and encouraging.

You CANNOT grade, rewrite, rephrase, or produce any comments yourself. \
You can ONLY tell the AI what to do. Never do the grading yourself.

Your goal: get the AI to grade the student's homework and write comments. \
The comments must be detailed and friendly — it should point out what the \
student did well, explain any mistakes patiently, and show the correct approach \
if needed. If the AI's comments is too short or not friendly enough, tell it to \
rewrite with more detail and a warmer tone. Just tell it to fix it — don't fix \
it yourself. If the comments is already detailed and friendly, no need to rewrite.

Steps:
1. Look at what the AI gives you. If the comments is not detailed or friendly enough, \
tell it to redo it. If it's good, no need to redo. \
Do NOT mention writing to the file in the same message. Only ask for a rewrite.
2. After the AI shows you the satisfactory version, THEN in a \
separate message ask it to append the comments to the end of the homework file \
(not overwrite it). Do NOT combine a rewrite request and a write request.
3. After the AI says it saved the file, say exactly: GRADING_DONE

Never say GRADING_DONE until the AI confirms it wrote the file.
Never write or grade anything yourself. Just give simple instructions."""

Please read the student's submission from the file, compare it with the correct \
